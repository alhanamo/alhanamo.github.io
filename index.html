      <h3>Ali Mohammed</h3>
      <p> I have started the Bootcamp with barely any experience in programming.
          I did computer science for GCSEs a few years back with similar variables.
          This got my remembering things like for loops, if statements etc. Bootcamp has 
          definitely improved my coding skills and it will only get better. I've had a
          couple obstacles while coding for my project but luckily they weren't impossible
          simple fixes and errors.  </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Project</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project uses various different skills I've learnt
        in these 2 weeks. The sole aim of my project is to use any image, in my case I
        used 3 different animals. There's different size ellipses depending on the brightness of 
        the shades of the images by simply movinf the mouse in the x and y axis. The
        x-axis flattens the ellipses and the y-axis makes the image more defined and 
        painting-like which I find really interesting. I made my project switch between 
        the animals using keyPressed() and also adding colour to the images that are not
        just black and white.
