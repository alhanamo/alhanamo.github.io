      <h3>Ali Mohammed</h3>
      <p> I have started the Bootcamp with barely any experience in programming.
          I did computer science for GCSEs a few years back with similar variables.
          This got my remembering things like for loops, if statements etc. Bootcamp has 
          definitely improved my coding skills and it will only get better. I've had a
          couple obstacles while coding for my project but luckily they weren't impossible
          simple fixes and errors.  </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Project</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project uses various different skills I've learnt
        in these 2 weeks. The sole aim of my project is to use any image, in my case I
        used 3 different animals. There's different size ellipses depending on the brightness of 
        the shades of the images by simply movinf the mouse in the x and y axis. The
        x-axis flattens the ellipses and the y-axis makes the image more defined and 
        painting-like which I find really interesting. I made my project switch between 
        the animals using keyPressed() and also adding colour to the images that are not
        just black and white.

    <h3>March 2021: Vector 2.0</h3>
    <p>
	This project was very interesting and had fun making. Starting the game for was definitely the hardest part; trying to come up with the ideas and trying to make it work. Vector is a military type game where the player's mission is to retrieve the briefcase. I made 4 different levels with varying difficulty where if a platform is too high then a wooden box could be released to help reach. All levels come with different backgrounds as well different background music. The player has 3 Lives in which if comes in contact with the enemy a life is lost. There are two different extra power ability when the Question Mark is collected; one that enable player to jump higher and the other to make him run faster. I have added buttons for: pause, restart, quit and next level. Another great feature is the save and load method by pressing the 'S' or the 'L' Keys. This allows to save the state and position of the game to a textfile by saving(S) and then load it(L).<br><br>
    Challenges I have encountered is definately making the buttons manually rather than using GUI JPanel. This took quite a bit of time making. Also another challenge for me is makinf the opponent slide between pillers which at first was going to one pillar and not bouncing back. Finally another challenge was finding the sounds for the player collides with other bodies as I wanted the sound to be linked with the theme if the game. I didn't talk much during the Game play as I wanted to try and include most features during the 2 minutes. I hope that this description explains it all.<br>
    I have really enjoyed making this game despite all the challenges and error and a lot of debugging and hope to create an even better games in the upcoming years.
